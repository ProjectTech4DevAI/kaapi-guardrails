## Coverage (3,766 cases, 12 validators)

| Validator | Origin | Rows | FAIL | PASS | Notes |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| `content_safety` | Benchmark (hasoc, sharechat, lexical) | 1,801 | 1,139 | 662 | `source_dataset` column kept |
| `uli_slur_match` | Synthetic | 79 | 41 | 38 | `slur_severity` column |
| `profanity_free` | Synthetic | 79 | 43 | 36 | |

| `pii_remover` | Benchmark | 419 | 256 | 163 | `pii_entities`, `entity_count` from target placeholders |
| `gender_assumption_bias` | Benchmark | 600 | 300 | 300 | PASS rows = neutral rewrites, same as the runner |
| `topic_relevance_llm` | Benchmark (education + healthcare) | 355 | 115 | 240 | `TR-EDU` / `TR-HEALTH` configs |
| `topic_relevance` | Synthetic (agriculture) | 70 | 38 | 32 | new `TR-AGRI` allowed-topics config |
| `ban_list` | Synthetic | 79 | 47 | 32 | `BAN-MATERNAL`, `BAN-EDU`; `banned_term_hit` column |
| `answer_relevance_custom_llm` | Synthetic | 72 | 42 | 30 | `query` / `answer` columns + JSON `input_text` |
| `llm_critic` | Synthetic | 72 | 43 | 29 | `failing_metrics` column; `CRIT-NGO` rubric |

Each synthetic set mixes English, Hindi in Devanagari, and Hinglish. Each includes hard negatives: benign text that looks risky.

## Workbook structure

- **README**: column dictionary, how to run the set periodically, and data caveats.
- **Index**: one row per validator with origin, positive-class meaning, recommended stage, runner script, coverage counts by label and language, and live TP/FP/FN/TN, accuracy, precision, recall and F1 formulas. The metrics fill in once `actual_result` is entered.
- **Configs**: exact parameters behind every `config_ref`, including topic configs, ban lists and the critic rubric.
- **12 validator sheets**: they share a schema: `case_id, validator, input_text, expected_result, label, expected_output, category, difficulty, language, domain, config_ref, source, notes`, then validator-specific columns, then the yellow run columns `actual_result`, `actual_output` and `match`.
- **Run_Log**: one row per validator per run (date, git SHA, model, metrics, latency).

Convention: `expected_result = FAIL` means the validator **should trigger** (ground truth). Labels follow intent, not what the validator is expected to output, so known misses stay in the set on purpose.

## Bugs found and fixed in this PR

### 1. BanList fix left the first letter of every banned word

The hub `guardrails_ai.ban_list.BanList` maps spaceless indices to 1-based positions, so every span starts one character late:

- `"Can I get a sonography to know"` became `"Can I get a s to know"`.
- `"this contains badword"` became `"this contains b"`.

Fix: added `app/core/validators/ban_list.py`, a subclass with 0-based spans, and pointed `BanListSafetyValidatorConfig` and `app/evaluation/ban_list/run.py` at it.

- Exact match on the synthetic ban-list FAIL rows (after collapsing whitespace) went from **0/37 to 34/37**.
- Four integration tests in `test_guardrails_api_integration.py` had the buggy output in their expected values. They now expect the banned word removed completely.
- `error_spans` now point at the banned word itself.

### 2. Slur list entries with nukta letters never matched

`LexicalSlur.normalize_for_matching` NFKC-normalizes the input, which decomposes precomposed nukta letters (ज़ → ज + ़). The list labels were only lowercased, so these 12 entries could never match:

नाजायज़, लौड़ा, लौड़े, बहन की लोड़ी, भाड़े का टट्टू, लोड़ू, तवाइफ़, दो कौड़ी की औरत, भड़वा, बत्तमीज़, पिछवाड़ा, बाज़ारू औरत

Fix: `load_slur_list` now NFKC-normalizes the labels. A regression test was added. `content_safety` reuses `LexicalSlur`, so it is fixed too.

## Other validator findings (not fixed)

**`uli_slur_match`**
- The list contains many everyday words that cause false positives: mad, crazy, stupid, contempt, illiterate, homo, poop, kala, halwa, chakki (severity H), mc, dyan, hilana, chamcha, bai, pataka, kutta, साली, टट्टी.
- Devanagari matches inside longer words, because vowel signs and halant aren't `\w` for the boundary check. For example, मूत्र (urine) is flagged as मूत, and सूअरों is flagged as सूअर.
- Duplicate list entries (cunt, randi, saali, bhenchod) appear twice in the error message.
- Victims quoting abuse they received are flagged. These are labelled PASS in the set.

**`profanity_free` (alt-profanity-check)**
- It misses all Devanagari profanity (prob ≈ 0.04) and most romanized-Hindi profanity.
- It misses obfuscations such as `sh1t`, `f u c k`, `b!tch` and `a$$hole`.
- False positives:
  - "The cock crows" (0.99)
  - "Our bitch is pregnant" (dog breeding, 0.98)
  - "stupid weather" (0.99)
  - clinical words: "penis swollen" (0.66), "vagina discharge" (0.52), "testicles" (0.53)

**`ban_list`**
- Fuzzy matching (Levenshtein 1, spaces ignored) causes false positives across word boundaries:
  - Sonographer
  - "gender checklist"
  - monography
  - "roof leaked; paper"
  - "Approx. attendance"
  - "cake certificate"
- Hindi transliterations (सोनोग्राफी, "ling jaanch") and 2-edit typos (sonograhpy, sonografy) are missed.
- Inflections leave suffixes behind (`Are sonographies safe?` → `Are es safe?`).

**`nsfw_text`**
- The default model is English-only, so about 10 Hindi and Hinglish FAIL rows are expected misses.
- The PASS side deliberately includes clinical sexual-health wording, which is the main false-positive risk for maternal-health bots.

**`answer_relevance_custom_llm`**
- The strict default prompt is expected to reject short but correct answers (`relevant_concise`).
- It is also expected to reject correct safe redirects (`safe_redirect`), such as a self-harm ask answered with the Tele-MANAS helpline.
- These are labelled PASS. Use a custom prompt if redirects should pass.

**`topic_relevance`**
- LLMCritic uses `max_score=3`, so only a score of 3 passes and "partially related" (2) fails.
- Ambiguous agriculture-adjacent asks (gold loan, MGNREGA, a farmer's health insurance) are labelled per the `TR-AGRI` config and noted as hard cases.

## Baselines from the existing runs (`*/output/`)

| Validator | Dataset | Precision | Recall | F1 | Latency (mean) |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `uli_slur_match` | content safety, all | 0.90 | 0.63 | 0.74 | 1.0 ms |
| ↳ | hasoc / sharechat / lexical (recall) | | 0.19 / 0.33 / 1.00 | | |
| `profanity_free` | content safety, all | 0.78 | 0.23 | 0.36 | 3.6 ms |
| slur + profanity combined | content safety, all | 0.85 | 0.72 | 0.78 | |
| `pii_remover` | PII set | 0.92 | 0.80 | 0.86 | 10.6 ms |
| `gender_assumption_bias` | 300 biased + 300 neutral | 0.76 | 0.87 | 0.81 | 0.3 ms |
| `topic_relevance_llm` | education + healthcare | 0.90 | 0.76 | 0.82 | |

These ran before the slur-list fix. Re-run `content_safety` and `uli_slur_match` to measure the change.

## Data caveats

- **content_safety:** about 99% of the 601 `lexical` rows contain a term from the slur list, which is why slur recall is 1.00 there. Report metrics per `source_dataset`.
- **content_safety:** language comes from the source datasets. Hindi rows without Devanagari script are tagged `hi-Latn`. Some rows the source labels "English" are actually Hinglish.
- **gender_assumption_bias:** only 15 unique biased sentences, each repeated 20 times. Duplicates are flagged in `notes`. The set needs more variety, especially already-neutral sentences that contain no gendered rewrite.
- **pii_remover:** per-entity precision is low for some types: `IN_PAN` 0.10 and `PHONE_NUMBER` 0.22 in the existing run. `JOBAREA` placeholders in `expected_output` have no matching recognizer (0/12 recall), so those rows can never fully match.
- **topic_relevance_llm:** `language` is auto-detected with a keyword heuristic.
- **Synthetic sets:** written by an LLM and spot-reviewed. Hard-case labels are a starting point; refine them with partner NGO data. Uncertain rows explain their label in `notes`.
- **Formulas:** the workbook's formulas calculate when the file is opened in Excel or Google Sheets. Tools that read cached values (pandas, `openpyxl data_only`) see empty metric cells until then.

## Suggested next steps

1. Add runners for `answer_relevance_custom_llm` and `llm_critic`, which have none yet. Point the existing runners at the workbook sheets, or export each sheet to CSV.
2. Re-run `uli_slur_match` and `content_safety` after the nukta fix, and log the results in Run_Log.
3. Prune the generic words from the slur list, or move them to a context-dependent severity.
4. Expand the gender set beyond 15 templates.
